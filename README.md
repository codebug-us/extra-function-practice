# Extra Practice

- Create a function called `takeMyOrder` that should take in someone's name and return "Hello, [The person's name]! What would you like to order?". For example, takeMyOrder("Joe") should return "Hello, Joe! What would you like to order?"

- Create a function called `isItGreaterThanOneHundred` that should take in a number. If the given number is greater than 100, it should return "Your number is HUGE". If the given number is less than 100, it should return "Your number is small".

- Create a function called `lengthCalculator` that should take in 3 strings. The function should calculated the combined length of all the strings and return the phrase `The combined length of your strings is [combined length of strings]`.

- Write a function called `lastThree` that returns the last 3 characters of a word. If the word is less than 3 characters long it should return "Your word is too short!".

- Write a function called `printer` that takes in an array and console.logs each value in the array. 
	```
	printer(["hi", "how", "are", "you"]);
	=> 
	"hi"
	"how"
	"are"
	"you"
	``` 


- Write a function called `upperCaser` that takes in an array of strings and console.logs each string in all caps. 
	```
	upperCaser(["my", "name", "is", "Karim"]);
	=> 
	"MY"
	"NAME"
	"IS"
	"KARIM"
	```

- Write a function called `greetMyDogs` that takes in an array of dog names and console.logs "Are you a good boy, [DOG NAME]?"
	```
	greetMyDogs(["Fred", "Perudo", "Milo", "Boots"]);
	=> 
	"Are you a good boy, Fred?"
	"Are you a good boy, Perudo?"
	"Are you a good boy, Milo?"
	"Are you a good boy, Boots?"
	```

- Write a function called `multiplyBySeven` that takes in an array of numbers and console.logs each number multiplied by 7. 
	```
	multiplyBySeven([1,5,6,0]);
	=> 
	7
	35
	42
	0
	```

- Write a function called `multiplyMe` that takes in two parameters (an array of numbers and a single number). The function should console.log each number in the array multiplied by the single number. 
	```
	multiplyMe([1,5,6,0], 10);
	=> 
	10
	50
	60
	0
	```
	```
	multiplyMe([1,5,6,0], 5);
	=> 
	5
	25
	30
	0
	```
